/*
* In java we have mainly two types of data types
* 1. primitive
* 		boolean either true or false - Boolean
* 		char which will store single character - Character
*		byte store integer values - Byte
*		short store integer values - Short
*		int store integer values -Integer
*		long store integer values - Long
*		float store floating point number -Float
*		double store floating point number - Double
* 	
* 2. reference
* 		Arrays
* 		Strings
* 
*  Wrapper class: For every primitive data_type we have an equivalent class in Java. Those classes
* are known as Wrapper classes. These are used to perform different operations on data.
* 		1. Boolean
* 		2. Character
* 		3. Byte
* 		4. Short
* 		5. Integer
* 		6. Long
* 		7. Float
* 		8. Double
* 
* 	WCData_type obj_name = new WCData_type(value);
* 
* 	Type Casting: converting one type of primitive data to another type of primitive data
* 	up casting: lower memory type to higher memory type : widening : no data loss
* 	down casting: higher memory data type to lower memory data type : narrowing : data loss is possible
* 
* Converting primitive data type to wrapper class: boxing
*  Converting wrapper to primitive : un-boxing
* 
* 
* syntax to create primitive data type
* data-type var-name  = value; //initialization
* data-type var-name; //declaration
* var-name = value; //assignment to the variable which is already declared
* 
* variable is nothing but name of memory location where we are storing data
