 * Variable is name of memory location where we store data. 
*
* if we want to make any variable as constant then use "final" keyword.
* 
* Types of variables
* 
* 1.Instance variables 
* 		It is a variable which is declared inside the class but outside of any method. 
* These are object level. We can access these variables directly inside the class 
* instance methods and by creating an object of the class in same class static methods 
* and outside the class. 
* Variable declaration
* 		access_modifier data_type var_name; 
* accessing variable 
* 		object_name.var_name = value; 
* Initialization variable: At the time of variable declaration we are going to assign some value 
* 		access_modifier data_type var_name = value;
* 
* 2.static variables 
* 		It is a variable which declared inside the class and outside of any method 
* but declared using 'static' keyword. These are class level i.e. object to object these 
* variables will share the information. We can access these variables directly inside the 
* class and by using class_name outside the class.
* Variable declaration 
* 		access_modifier static data_type var_name; 
* accessing variable 
* 		class_name.var_name = value; 
* Initialization
* 		access_modifier static data_type var_name = value;
* 
* 3.local variables 
* 		It is variable which is declared inside any method. we can
* access this variable inside the method only. 
* Variable declaration 
* 		data_type var_name; 
* accessing variable 
* 		var_name = value; 
* Initialization 
* data_type var_name = value;
* 
*  | var type | inside the class instance method | inside the class static method | outside the class  | 
 * | instance | directly						 | by creating object			  | by creating object |
 * | static   | directly						 | directly or by class name	  | by class name	   |
 * 
 * 
 * Creating an object of the class
 * 
 * Class_name obj_name = new Class_name()
